# Face Detection Using OpenCV (C++)

This repository contains a simple implementation of face detection using OpenCV in C++. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use OpenCV's built-in functionalities to detect faces in images or video streams.

## Overview

Face detection is achieved using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier, which provides a straightforward way to identify faces in real-time or pre-recorded media. This implementation uses basic logic to detect and highlight faces in the input source.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Detect faces from a webcam feed.
- **Image-based Face Detection:** Apply detection to static images.
- **Video File Processing:** Detect faces in video files.

2. Install OpenCV on your system if it is not already installed. Refer to the [OpenCV installation guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html).

## Usage

1. Provide the input source (webcam, image, or video file) via the application.
2. The program will process the input and display the detected faces highlighted with bounding boxes.
